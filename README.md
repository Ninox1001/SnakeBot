SnakeBot
 In this document I present to you the different elements that I realized for my 3-month
internship subject on the design of a snake robot
 In the folder there are 3 subfolders:
● FreeCad
● CoppeliaSim
● Python

 In the FreeCad folder there are the different 3D designs made in two forms: a .FCStd  file which are the blocks made and a .stl file which are the files made for printing.

 In the CoppeliaSim file we find a simulation of the robot made from the 3d parts of the robot.
 
 In the python folder there are 5 different codes on the control of the snake:
 
● motor.py : This code makes it possible to control a motor by giving its identifier and to make it do a lap.
● simple.py : The simple code corresponds to the movement in degrees made by the snake, it does not communicate with the motors and displays the angles each time the keyboard is pressed.
●snakebot.py : This code is a mixture of the first two, it makes the snake move forward each time and it communicates with the motors.
●snakebot.py : this code launches the movement of the snake it is sure this one that I worked at the end of my internship so it is still in test and improvement

In addition to the soft documents that I leave there is an existing model already
printed. it is more or less complete but there are still improvements to be made on the friction
of the wheels
